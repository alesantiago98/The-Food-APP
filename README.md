## Objetivos del Proyecto
Recipes app created with React, Redux, Express, Sequelize and PostgreSQL.

On the homepage you'll have several recipes and can search any recipes by name and it will show some results with basic info of the recipes.

Every card has a More Info button that will show you a new page with the complete info of the recipe, in which you can find the name, diets, health score and rating from other users. Every card has a star that includes the recipe in your favorites, and in the favorites page you can see every card of the recipes you've liked!
